# SpriteDumper
Mod for dumping sprites and wiki pages for the wiki at http://docs.skylinesmodding.com!
It's not really perfect but it does it's job.

When using this mod just press CTRL + SHIFT + D to dump the sprites and wiki pages.
It will dump all sprites to: ``[STEAM FOLDER]\SteamApps\common\Cities_Skylines\UISprites``
You can then just drag and drop the sprites/wiki pages in your local repo of the docs and create a PR with the changes.

If you want to change the content of the sprites pages please create a PR for this mod and don't edit the pages manually.
All the text can be found in the ``SpriteDumperObj.cs`` class.
